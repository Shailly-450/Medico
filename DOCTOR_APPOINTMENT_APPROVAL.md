# Doctor Appointment Approval Feature

## Overview
This implementation provides a complete doctor appointment approval system that integrates with the existing appointment API. Doctors can view, filter, and approve/reject pending appointments through a dedicated dashboard.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Doctor Appointment Service (`lib/core/services/doctor_appointment_service.dart`)
- **getDoctorAppointments()**: Fetches all appointments for the current doctor
- **getPendingApprovalAppointments()**: Fetches only pending appointments
- **getTodayAppointments()**: Fetches today's approved appointments
- **updateAppointmentStatus()**: Updates appointment status (approve/reject)
- **getAppointmentById()**: Fetches specific appointment details

### 2. Doctor Appointment View Model (`lib/viewmodels/doctor_appointment_view_model.dart`)
- Manages appointment data and state
- Handles filtering (All, Pending, Today)
- Provides computed properties for statistics
- Follows MVVM pattern with Provider

### 3. Doctor Appointments Panel (`lib/views/doctor/doctor_appointments_panel.dart`)
- Real-time appointment list with filtering
- Approve/Reject buttons for pending appointments
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Error handling and loading states
- Uses Provider for state management

### 4. Doctor Appointment Detail Screen (`lib/views/doctor/doctor_appointment_detail_screen.dart`)
- Detailed view of individual appointments
- Patient information display
- Appointment approval/rejection actions
- Loading states during updates

### 5. Updated Doctor Dashboard (`lib/views/doctor/doctor_dashboard_screen.dart`)
- Real-time statistics (Today's appointments, Pending reviews, Total appointments)
- Quick access to appointment management
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Integration with real API data

## API Integration

The implementation uses the existing appointment API endpoints:

```javascript
// From the provided Express.js router
router.get('/', authenticateToken, appointmentController.getAppointments);
router.put('/:id', authenticateToken, appointmentController.updateAppointment);
```

### API Calls Made:
1. **GET /appointments** - Fetches appointments with filters (doctorId, status, preApprovalStatus)
2. **PUT /appointments/:id** - Updates appointment status (preApprovalStatus field)
3. **GET /appointments/:id** - Fetches specific appointment details

## Usage

### For Doctors:
1. **Dashboard Overview**: View today's appointments, pending reviews, and total appointments
2. **Appointment Management**: Navigate to "Manage Appointments" to see all appointments
3. **Filtering**: Use filter chips to view All, Pending, or Today's appointments
4. **Approval Actions**: Click "Approve" or "Reject" buttons on pending appointments
5. **Detail View**: Tap on any appointment to see detailed information

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Updates**: Appointments refresh automatically after status changes
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and retry functionality
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during API calls
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes
- **No Dummy Data**: All data comes from the real API

## Technical Implementation

### State Management:
- Uses Provider pattern for state management
- ViewModel handles business logic and API calls
- UI components are reactive to state changes

### Error Handling:
- Network error handling
- API error response handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry functionality

### Performance:
- Efficient list rendering with ListView.separated
- Proper disposal of resources
- Optimized API calls with filters
