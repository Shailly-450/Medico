# Health Records Family Integration

## Overview

The health records system has been enhanced to support multiple family members, allowing users to manage health records for their entire family from a single interface.

## Key Features

### 1. Family Member Association
- Each health record is now linked to a specific family member via `familyMemberId`
- Health records are automatically filtered based on the selected family member
- Users can switch between family members to view their respective health records

### 2. Family Member Selector
- A dropdown selector in the health records screen header allows switching between family members
- Shows the current family member's avatar, name, and record count
- Displays record counts for each family member in the dropdown

### 3. Family Health Summary
- A horizontal scrollable section showing all family members
- Each family member card displays:
  - Avatar (or initials if no image)
  - Name
  - Number of health records
- Current family member is highlighted with a border
- Tap any family member card to switch to their records

### 4. Visual Indicators
- Health record cards show a small family member avatar indicator
- Health record detail screen displays the associated family member prominently
- All dialogs (add, upload, export, share) show which family member they apply to

## Technical Implementation

### Models Updated

#### HealthRecord Model
```dart
class HealthRecord {
  // ... existing fields
  final String familyMemberId; // New field

  });
}
```

#### FamilyMember Model
```dart

  final String id;

}
```
